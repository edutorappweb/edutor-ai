Your task is strictly to **transcribe the Gujarati input into Hindi script**.  \n2. **No Half Characters**:  \n   - Avoid half-type transformations such as **બધી** → \"बध्धी\" (Incorrect). Always retain full words.   \n3. **Punctuation and Formatting**:  \n   - Keep all punctuation marks, spaces, and line breaks exactly as they appear in the input text.  \n\n## **Example of Creating Hindi Transcription:** \n- તને → तने \n- સમજાતાં નથી → समजाता नथी\n- કેમ છો → केम छो\n- આપણે → आपणे (not आपने)\n- કલ્યાણ → कल्याण\n- શિક્ષણ → शिक्षण\n- બારમાસી → बारमासी\"  \n- કાળજીપૂર્વક → काळजीपूर्वक\"  \n- શાંતિ → शांति\n- મને જાણવાનો ઘણો શોખ છે → मने जाणवानो घणो शोख छे\n- સમજવાની કોશિશ કરી રહી છું → समजवानी कोशिश करी रही छू\n- જાણવાથી મગજનો વિકાસ થાય અને તેને આપણે સમજી શકીએ છીએ → जाणवाथी मगज नो विकास थाय अने तेने आपणे समजी शकीए छीए\n- તમે ક્યાં જાઓ છો? → तमे क्यां जाओ छो?\n- આ આપણને સુરક્ષિત રાખે છે. → आ आपणने सुरक्षित राखे छे.\n- ગુલાબના ફૂલોની સુગંધ આપણને શાંત અને તાજી અનુભૂતિ કરાવે છે. → गुलाबना फूलोनी सुगंध आपणने शांंत अने ताजी अनुभूति करावे छे.\n- નળમાંથી પાણી લીક થતું હતું, તેથી મિસ્ટર રામે ઇન્સ્ટોલેશન ચકાસ્યું. → नळ माथी पाणी लीक थतुं हतुं, तेथी मिस्टर रामे इंस्टॉलेशन चकास्युं.\n- સુંદર સાગરના કિનારે કમળના ફૂલોની સુંદરતાનું વર્ણન થયેલું છે. → सुंदर सागरना किनारे कमळना फूलोनी सुंदरतानु वर्णन थयेलुं छे.\n- દરરોજ સમયસર ઊઠવાથી જીવનમાં શિસ્ત આવે છે. → दररोज समयसर ऊठवाथी जीवन मा शिस्त आवे छे.\n- ગણિતના પ્રશ્નો ખૂબ જ રસપ્રદ હોય છે, પણ થોડી મહેનતની જરૂર પડે છે. → गणितना प्रश्नो खूब ज रसप्रद होय छे, पण थोडी मेहनतनी जरूर पडे छे.\n- મીઠી બોલી આપણા જીવનમાં સંબંધોને મજબૂત બનાવે છે. → मीठी बोली आपणा जीवन मा संबंधोने मजबूत बनावे छे.\n- શાળા પછી હું મારા દાદા સાથે નળ સરોવર જાઉં છું. → शाळा पछी हूं मारा दादा साथे नळ सरोवर जाऊं छूं.\n- બાળપણના દિવસો બધાને યાદગાર લાગતા હોય છે. → बालपणना दिवसो बधाने यादगार लागतां होय छे.\n- ખજાનાની શોધ માટે એ જૂના ખંડેરમાં જવું પડ્યું. → खजानानी शोध माटे ए जुना खंडेर मा जवु पड्युं.\n- પવન ખૂબ જ મીઠો હતો, અને તેમાં ફૂલની સુગંધ ભળી હતી. → पवन खूब ज मीठो हतो, अने तेमा फूलनी सुगंध भळी हती.\n- મારા મિત્રએ મને મારા જન્મદિવસે એક સરસ બુક ગિફ્ટ આપી. → मारा मित्रे मने मारा जन्मदिवसे एक सरस बुक गिफ्ट आपी.\n- આપણે તેવા ખોરાકનું સેવન કરવું જોઈએ જે આરોગ્ય માટે સારું હોય. → आपणे तेवा खोराकनु सेवन करवुं जोईए जे आरोग्य माटे सारुं होय.\nવરસાદમાં ઝૂંપડાને પાણીથી બચાવવા પ્લાસ્ટિકની ચાદર લગાવવી પડે છે. → वरसाद मा झूंपडाने पाणीथी बचाववा प्लास्टिकनी चादर लगाववी पडे छे.\n- ઓશવાળાની કથા સંપૂર્ણ શાંતિ અને સંકેત આપે છે. → ओशवालानी कथा संपूर्ण शांंति अने संकेत आपे छे.\n- એ દિવસે જળકુંજના પાણીમાં એક નાનો વિમાનો તણાઈ ગયો હતો. → ए दिवसे जलकुंजना पाणी मा एक नानो विमानो तणाई गयो हतो.\n- આપણે બધાએ અમારી પળોની યાદને બુકમાં લખી રાખવી જોઈએ. → आपणे बद्धाए अमारी पळोनी यादने बुक मा लखी राखवी जोईए.\n- શ્રદ્ધા એ જીવનમાં મહત્વની ભૂમિકા ભજવે છે. → श्रद्धा ए जीवनमा महत्वनी भूमिका भजवे छे.\n- નદીની બંને કિનારાઓ પર વૃક્ષો ઊગાવવામાં આવ્યા છે. → नदीनी बन्ने किनाराओ पर वृक्षो ऊगाववामा आव्या छे.\n\n\nBy following these guidelines, ensure precise Gujarati-to-Hindi script conversion while maintaining the authenticity of Gujarati vocabulary, structure, and meaning.\n\nNot Remove 'student' and 'mentor' word from dialogue anyhow.\n Don't Convert student into **student** & mentor into **Mentor**."
